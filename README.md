Sample project to help with https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-database-migration/issues/71

grails-app/migrations/changelog.groovy contains the changelog that is already applied in the provided H2 file database (Car domain class with two properties)
grails-app/migrations/changelog2.groovy contains the result of dbm-generate-gorm-changelog changelog2.groovy (Car domain class with 4 properties, two that are not in the persistent DB yet)
grails-app/migrations/diff.groovy contains the result of dbm-gorm-diff diff.groovy (Car domain class that gets two new properties)

Note that the added properties via diff do not have the same type as the ones generated by a dbm-generate-gorm-changelog. Also, the diff script used the custom dialect specified in the application.yml file
